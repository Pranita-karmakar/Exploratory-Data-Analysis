#  Project Summary[](url)
The analysis of the Airbnb dataset has revealed valuable insights into various aspects of the listings in New York City. The majority of listings are in the "Entire home/apt" and "Private room" categories, indicating a preference for privacy and independence. Manhattan and Brooklyn are the most popular neighbourhoods, with higher prices and longer minimum stay requirements compared to other areas. The analysis has also highlighted the importance of pricing and availability, with variations based on room types and neighbourhoods. Geographical analysis has identified specific regions with higher prices and longer minimum stay requirements, providing guidance for selecting suitable accommodations.
Based on these insights, several solutions have been proposed to address business problems. These include refining pricing strategies, promoting underrepresented neighbourhoods, enhancing search filters and user interfaces, and improving guest experiences. The findings also emphasize the significance of data-driven decision making and collaborations with local authorities to optimize operations and comply with regulations. By leveraging these insights, Airbnb can enhance the user experience, attract more hosts and guests, and improve overall business performance in the competitive short-term rental market in New York City.
